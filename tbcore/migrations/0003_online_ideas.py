<li><a href="https://digitale-lehre.virtuos.uni-osnabrueck.de/eintrag/etherpad/">Etherpad:</a> Etherpad is a simple collaborative online writing environment. Its primary focus is the text itself instead of complex format templates; this enables fast and smooth joint writing, making it an ideal tool for writing short texts such as problem statements.  </li>
<li><a href="https://academiccloud.de/services">Cloud: </a>ONLYOFFICE provided by Academic Cloud is a tool similar to google docs that students can use as a word processor to formulate their problem statements. </li>
<li><a href="https://hilfe.studip.de/help/5.0/de/Basis/CoursewareSeite">Courseware:</a> Create a page for each student in the courseware of your course in which they write their problem statement. Ideally, you create a problem-statement template with writing prompts in you workspace in stud.IP and copy it as many times as the number of students into your courseware. Now, you can give editing and reading rights to individual students or groups for pages within courseware and you can make pages invisible for certain participants. </li>
