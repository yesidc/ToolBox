brief_description: "In a reflection portfolio, students showcase their learning process. For assessment, let them elaborate on the same question twice and let them self-assess \nthe growth of sophistication in their answer. You can even provoke them with “unanswerable” (essential) questions and have them justify their answers. \n",

You can give upload rights to particular students in the task section of somebody else, so, they can give feedback to each other or submit an assignment together.\n- <a href=\"https://hilfe.studip.de/help/5.0/en/Basis/CoursewareSeite\" target=\"_blank\">Courseware</a>: Create a page for each student in the courseware of your course in which they write their portfolio. \n\tIdeally, you create a reflection portfolio template with writing prompts in your workspace in stud.IP and copy it as many times as the number of students into your courseware. \nNow, you can give editing and reading rights to individual students or groups for pages within courseware and you can make pages invisible for certain participants. \n",

testimony: "„Ich war ja erst skeptisch was die individual reflection portfolios angeht, aber ich lese gerade einen Teil und das ist so toll was die schreiben!
