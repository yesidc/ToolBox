brief_description: "It's much easier to participate when we know how to. \n\nModel how and when you want students to participate in discussions and provoke their opinions and \nthoughts in your discussion forum/ Chat.  If you invite them to share additional learning material that \nthey encountered, do so as well and provide it with a short info! \n\nFurther, students bear some responsibility for the success of the course, including a (potentially) \ncold or fun atmosphere, so do communicate your expectations as well as your vision for the chat clearly: is it a “tea room”, a “Q&A”, a \"library of threads and contributions on specific topics\" or should it be considered a “glossary” etc.? \n\nAfter all, if you want your students to be active in written discussions, practice as you preach.\n",
technology: "1. <a href=\"https://hilfe.studip.de/help/4.0/en/Basis/StartseiteNews\" target=\"_blank\">Stud.IP announcements</a>: you can state your intentions for course interaction and discussion in a \nprominent place in Stud.IP.\n2. <a href=\"https://teaching-toolbox.uni-osnabrueck.de/organization/teaching_tool/9/\" target=\"_blank\">Syllabus</a>: to state your intentions for course interaction and discussion. \n3. <a href=\"https://teaching-toolbox.uni-osnabrueck.de/organization/teaching_tool/23/\" target=\"_blank\">Weekly e-mails</a>: Use your first course email to set the tone of the course. \n",
  implementation_steps: "1. Communicate very hands-on in a prominent place what you expect students to do regarding: \n- Preparing sessions/ following the courseware material (workload), \n- How to handle uncertainties about a topic,\n- When to reach out and respond to others,\n- Additionally, clarify what students can expect from you. \n2. Do what you preach and get involved in the discussion forum / chat by:\n- Posting thought-provoking questions,\n- Posting controversial news articles or quotes about the topics,\n- Ask for student's opinions,\n- Use anonymized old assignment results to illustrate a point you made in class or in the courseware. \n",
teacher_effort: "*MINI: You can use these tips quickly and with little effort in your current teaching.*\n",
recommendations: "Consider recording a short video in which you explain your teaching approach as to underline the \nreasoning for your expectations and intentions (for tools and implementation steps see <a href=\"https://teaching-toolbox.uni-osnabrueck.de/teaching-material/teaching_tool/22/\" target=\"_blank\">Micro lectures</a>). \n- Include guidance on how to succeed in the course (and what interferes with success) if this is \nconnected to how you intend the interactions to go. \n- A code of conduct clarifies how you expect \neveryone to respond to each other.\n- Literature finds that more demanding courses with high expectations are rated better by students. \n",
