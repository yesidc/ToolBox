idea_id: "023-idea-sct",
brief_description: "Ask students for their opinions, their learning needs and ideas and discuss results at a time \nthat can still lead to changes. For example, you can also ask them to choose a topic (from a list), \nhow they want to use the course for learning, what their expectations are or how and why they want to use \nthe online material, so you can adjust your course to their needs. \n\nFurther, initiating a dialog about the learning process of students shows that you have a true interest in \nhow well students learn in your course.  Adopt a “culture of meta comments” by regularly discussing the \nreasoning behind your assignment design, expectations or teaching set-up and respond to student voices and wishes.\n",
