idea_id: "009-idea-afm",
brief_description: "### Pedagogical Role \nDiscussion boards or forums need a moderator who focuses on the **facilitation and guidance of learning**\nin online discussions by posing questions that focus on critical concepts,\nprinciples and skills, on-topic discussions and by prompting critical questions to stimulate active \nstudent participation (Berge, 2008; Salmon, 2013). \n### Social Role\nCreate an environment with **positive relationships and a safe atmosphere** by posing challenging \nquestions and offering feedback about the learning progress and results. Student perceptions about the \nlearning environment and hence also the forum or discussion boards, are important when it comes to \nlearning satisfaction. These perceptions are also based on social factors \n(Anderson, Rourke, Garrison & Archer, 2001; Martin, Ritzhaupt, Kumar & Budhrani, 2019).",
