brief_description: "### The learning process \nIn discussion forums, moderators have two roles, a pedagogical and a social role. One is directed at \n**pedagocical facilitation and guidance of learning** and the other focuses on social aspects such as creating an environment with **positive relationships and a safe\natmosphere**. \n\nDiscussion boards moderators have to **facilitate and guide learning**\nin online discussions, for instance by  \n- posing questions that focus on critical concepts, principles and skills, \n- prompting controversial questions to activate students\n- maintaining focus on the topic (Berge, 2008; Salmon, 2013). \n\nThe pedagogical tasks are about making sure that students encounter enough thought stimulating \nquestions and challenges and that misunderstandings are corrected.\n\n### The learning atmosphere\n\nThe social learning environment is equally important for students to study effectively. \nModerators can stimulate a positive and warm atmosphere by picking up students' contributions\nand proactively offering feedback about the learning progress and results. \n\nSo, the social role of a facilitator is to create an environment with \n**positive relationships and a safe atmosphere**. This aspect focuses more on the social aspect of giving feedback than the content of feedback.\nHowever, both, social and pedagogical role are important for forum moderation (Anderson, Rourke, Garrison & Archer, 2001; Martin, Ritzhaupt, Kumar & Budhrani, 2019).
