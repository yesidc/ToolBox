idea_id: "005-idea-pr",
brief_description: "Students review each others' assignments based on given criteria and give feedback, which is then integrated or rejected with sound reasoning. Peer review helps to create awareness for assessment criteria and to think with the eyes of an external. Practising meta-cognition skills helps to detect issues quickly and to plan task implementation. \n",

  teacher_effort: "***MIDI** (Suitable for current teaching situations, but requires a little more preparation.)*\n\nYou have to come up with quality criteria which students can use to give feedback to each other. Further, peer feedback needs supervision and is not a sure-fire to success. So, additional effort for reading the feedback and managing late feedback is needed, but chances are that final submissions improve substantially.\n",
  recommendations: "- Clearly detail the procedure for peer feedback since it is easy to get confused about which group provides feedback for whom and to mix up deadlines.\n- Share your expectations clearly and assignment instructions to which the students can refer in their feedback.\n- Providing protocol templates/ examples for peer‚Äêreview that is focused on specific criteria helps students to see how they can support each other.\n",
