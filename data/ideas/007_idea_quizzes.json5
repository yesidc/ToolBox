idea_name:"Quizzes" ,
idea_id: "007-idea-q",
brief_description: "Quizzes activate students and make micro lectures much more effective. Quizzes can be multiple choice, open text entry, true or false are great to activate students, e.g. with self-tests. \n",
  technology: "* <a href=\"https://digitale-lehre.virtuos.uni-osnabrueck.de/eintrag/elektronische-uebungen-und-pruefungen-vips/\">VIPS</a>: There are several task types you can use to create quizzes. E.g., single choice, multiple choice, gap text etc.\n",
  implementation_steps: "* The content of the quizzes should be guided by the type of knowledge the students should gain from the content. For example, if they should know the facts, ask for a recall of the facts, but if they should understand a concept, try to keep the questions more open.\n* Quizzes are created based on learning objectives or the main idea that was meant to be tackled in the unit. \n* Be creative with the different types of format that can be used to create a quizz.\n",
  teacher_effort: "***MINI** (You can use this tip quickly and with little effort in your current teaching.)*\n\nStudent assistants need ~ 15-30 minutes to create 1-2 self-tests from the idea to VIPS implementation. \n",
  recommendations: "An easy way to create VIPS is to take a sentence from the lecture and make it a cloze text.\n\n* Use quizzes to gauge prior knowledge before starting a subsection.\n* Place the quizzes right before the micro lectures to activate prior knowledge. \n* Place quizzes right after a video to check understanding and cognitive presence.\n* Decide whether they get automated feedback or if the quizzes need manual review. \n* Regular quizzes can become part of the course routine and give students a course pace.\n* Quizzes can be used to enforce/ encourage students to work on subjects regularly. \n",
  supplementary_material: "If student assistants create the quizzes, they usually use only the lecture materials but sometimes also additional material (e.g. research papers or other websites) to verify the answers. \n",
  testimony: "",

  use_cases: "* Lectures which would be rather passive without quizzes. \n* During a synchronous live session to activate students.\n* Integrated into asynchronous course material (courseware) to activate students during self-study.\n",
