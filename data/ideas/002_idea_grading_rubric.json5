brief_description: "Grading rubrics put assessment criteria on a continuum and guide the grading based on the criteria that were established before the exam. They help communicating grades to students and show that learning and understanding is a process.",
technology: "- Upload the grading rubric PDF in the [files section](https://hilfe.studip.de/help/5.0/en/Basis/Dateien) and provide a PDF preview courseware with the [PDF preview block](https://hilfe.studip.de/help/5.0/en/Basis/CoursewareBloeckePDF) (before grading) \n- When graded hand out paper copy or send individual files via email or element.",
implementation_steps: "- Focus on describing, not evaluating. Rubrics are about quality not quantity.\n- When describing content, the following criteria will help: \n  - Accuracy \n  - Specificity and use of examples \n  - Relevance \n  - Completeness/ thoroughness (LCI Tips for writing quality rubrics and checklists)\n  \n<a href=\"https://lciltd.org/uploads/649b822b-3650-4246-bd2c-dea7624218a0-Process%20for%20developing%20standards_based%20rubrics.pdf\">Process for Developing Standards Based Rubrics</a>\n1. Describe the task\n2. Identify quality attributes/indicators\n3. Develop dimensions \n4. Describe the levels \n5. Use the rubric\n6. Revise the rubric \n",
  teacher_effort:"- Using the rubric while grading can reduce the time necessary to evaluate an assignment. \n- Preparing the rubric can take longer as the grading work is \"front-loaded\" but is highly dependent on the assignment type to be graded.\n- Using a rubric makes grading more transparent which reduces the extent of questions regarding grades. " ,
recommendations: "Only some of the criteria need to be met and certain criteria are more important than others. A rubric is meant to make the grading more accountable, but it should not provide an objective grade that can be calculated. This allows for flexible/ individual grading while sticking to criteria.
