idea_id: "010-idea-sdt",
brief_description: "Set aside some time after a session for students to ask questions, clarify issues or talk to you about non-topic/ course related stuff like their ideas for a thesis, or a project that they are working on. Usually, students are warmed up by the end of the session and have more specific questions. If questions are relevant for everyone, you can ask the student to post the question in the forum, which you will answer there again. This way, you can involve the person who asked, either online or in the next session.",

  implementation_steps: "1. Inform students that you will be available for about 15-20 after the session for casual discussions or any questions related to their studies. \n2. Ask them to bring a concrete question, topic, or issue. \n2. Invite students to take the opportunity and show that you're looking forward to speaking to them.",
teacher_effort: "15-20 minutes before or after a session or during a designated time slot of your choice. The time you spend on making yourself available is the time you used to spend to run from one room to the other.",
recommendations: "Proactively make time to talk to you with a welcoming tone. It's especially useful at the beginning and end of the semester when questions tend to arise. \nIf there are no pertinent issues to discuss, try to be open to talk about other non-topic related topics and set an informal and casual tone with the students to build trust. This will carry over to the more formal discussions during the session. \nMake explicit what you're probably doing anyway: students come to you and ask questions about the exam, some formality, the lecture set-up, the home work or discuss a study project with you.",
