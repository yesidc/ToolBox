# Rules & Regulation 


The DAAD-funded digital master’s program OS-COSMOS targets international students who can successfully complete their coursework remotely. Online and on-site students attend the same courses. Cosmos students can choose two out of three focus areas for this degree (Artificial Intelligence, Neuroinformatics, and Neuroscience). 

**Since they are part of the regular student body, all COSMOS students must have equivalent opportunities to study, participate and to be examined as on-site students** and course-specific online modalities must be covered by the examination regulation. If you open your course for online students, this means: 

•	If your course examination is on-site, COSMOS students must have the possibility to be examined online.  
•	Individual solutions for COSMOS students must be in line with the examination regulation (and module handbook).
•	Examinations must be within 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. in the time zone of the student. 
•	Every usage of technology must be GDPR compliant. 
•	Please consider that some COSMOS students cannot access tools like Google or YouTube – such tools cannot be part of obligatory course requirements. 
•	COSMOS students have a very diverse cultural background. This can lead them to deal with conflicts or difficulties in their studies in a way that we would not expect. Please be accommodating to the issues they experience and seek to talk to the students.
•	You can expect that COSMOS students have a reliable and stable internet connection as this is a requirement for the COSMOS track

### Examinations in online courses: 

Below you find a nonofficial translation of §7 (p.5) of the examination regulations, which state that the different types of course-related examinations may be conducted in electronic form, given the consent of the examiner. Please note that this translation is not legally binding. 
The examination regulations state regarding forms of course-related examinations: 

“Types of course-related examinations are:

- a)	term paper (paragraph 2),
- b)	Oral examination (paragraph 3),
- c)	presentation (paragraph 4),
- d)	presentation with elaboration (paragraph 5),
- e)	written examination (paragraph 6),
- f)	written examinations in the answer-choice procedure (multiple choice) (paragraph 7),
- g)	study project (paragraph 8),
- h)	empirical investigation and experimental work (paragraph 9),
- i)	exercise performance (Übungsleistung) (paragraph 10).


The concrete form of the respective examination performance is regulated by the module description. […] With the consent of the examiner, the in-process examinations may also be conducted in electronic form or using electronic media.” (status 09.11.2022)

### Some words about technology and tools: 
There are no tools that are privacy-compliant per se. It depends on what you do with it. VirtUOS makes sure certain basics are there, i.e. the tools offered by the UOS have undergone a basic GSDVO testing, making sure how and what data are stored according to the GSDVO. 
If you want to use other technology than offered and supported by UOS, you must make sure to use the technology in a DSGVO compliant way. If no personal data is processed, there are no data protection issues associated with it. In case of doubt, the data protection officer is responsible.
