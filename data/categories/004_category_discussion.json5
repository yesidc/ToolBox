// The fields titles_accordion and content_accordion are designed for you to provide additional information about a category/building block
// You can have as many paragraphs/sections as you wish. Every section must be accompanied by a heading. To create
//several sections you must use the special charters [SPLIT]. See example below:
// titles_accordion: 'HeadingSection1[SPLIT]HeadingSection2'
// content_accordion: 'Content1[SPLIT]Content2'
// The content above is displayed using accordions, but you can easily change the html code for it to be displayed differently (e.g. you can use lists, paragraphs etc.)

    description_1: "### What is My Role in Course Discussions? \nIn online courses, facilitating discourse is key to maintaining interest, student engagement, motivation and to support students’ understanding. In online courses, instructors have even more responsibility to “stimulate social process with a direct goal of stimulating individual and group learning” (Anderson et al., 2001) through various activities or posts. \nIf you do synchronous sessions, allow online participation. However, synchronous sessions always exclude some students. Alternative time slots are optimal and in online programs like COSMOS you may expect the study commission to ask you to move the session to a different time slot.",
  description_2: "### Why Does it Matter? \nDiscourse that critically reflects and questions the topics are an important part of learning. Online students should have equal opportunities to participate, to interact and understand concepts and topics of the course and have a chance to team up with on-site students for group assignments if necessary.\nPlease keep in mind that online students need an opportunity to ask questions and have a **clear and reliable expectation about when and how to get an answer** as they do not have opportunities to talk to you by chance in the hallway.",
