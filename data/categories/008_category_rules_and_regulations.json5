    short_description: "The students in the COSMOS track have a very diverse cultural background. This can lead them to deal with conflicts or difficulties in their studies in a way that we would not expect. Further, some cosmos students cannot access tools like Google or YouTube. Please be accommodating to the issues they experience and seek to talk to the students. Since they are part of the regular student body, all individual solutions must be covered by the examination regulation.\n- You can expect that COSMOS students have a reliable and stable internet connection as this is a requirement for the COSMOS track.\n- If your course examination is on-site, COSMOS students can make individual arrangements to be examined. \n- Special revisions / individual solutions for COSMOS students must be in line with the examination regulation (and module handbook)\n- All technical tools you use must be allowed by the data protection officer.\n- Examinations should be within 8 am and 8 pm in the time zone of the student. \n",
