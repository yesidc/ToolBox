// The fields titles_accordion and content_accordion are designed for you to provide additional information about a category/building block
// You can have as many paragraphs/sections as you wish. Every section must be accompanied by a heading. To create
//several sections you must use the special charters [SPLIT]. See example below:
// titles_accordion: 'HeadingSection1[SPLIT]HeadingSection2'
// content_accordion: 'Content1[SPLIT]Content2'
// The content above is displayed using accordions, but you can easily change the html code for it to be displayed differently (e.g. you can use lists, paragraphs etc.)

    description_1: "### What is Student Engagement? \n\n\"Student engagement refers to the degree of attention, curiosity, interest, optimism, and passion\nthat students show when they are learning or being taught, which extends to the level of motivation they \nhave to learn and progress in their education\" (<a href=\"https://www.edglossary.org/student-engagement/\">Student Engagement,</a> \nlast accesses 19.06.2023).",
    description_2:   "### Why does it matter? \n\nOnline students are not per se integrated in a study community and need explicit reminders and motivation to keep up with the course. \nCarefully crafted learning activities, interactions and a considerately designed learning environment support students to keep up with the course, when studying remotely can be isolating. \nMake sure you address information explicitly and communicate clearly, even though you would have otherwise relied on students “just knowing”.
