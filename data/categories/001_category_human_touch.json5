    short_description: "Human touch concerns everything that helps students and instructors see the others as real \npersons in an online course. \nIntroducing and sharing something about oneself that helps others to perceive your character.  \nThis could take place while talking about non-course related topics that are related to students’ \nextracurricular activities, social engagement in the study program and ideas for courses or study \nprojects. Further, there are things you don’t want to be recorded as a lecturer, e.g. talking about\nunofficial news. If you open your courses to online students, you are required to **offer equivalent opportunities to address topics that are not directly related to the topic of the course for online and on-site students.**",

The needs for \neither dimension are individual and so you have to see for yourself what kind of expressions are \nauthentic for you and be attentive for the students’ desire for ‘leaner’ or ‘richer’ \ninteraction modes. \n Adopted from: Getting closer und get involved: Digitale Nähe in der Online-Lehre gestalten\nDr. Sabine Fritz und Dr. Maja Bärenfänger1, Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen, Stand: 17.03.2022, Version 03.\n<img src=\"/static/tbcore/images/human_touch.png\" alt=\"Human Touch\" width=\"40%\" height=\"50%\" class=\"rounded mx-auto d-block\">",
