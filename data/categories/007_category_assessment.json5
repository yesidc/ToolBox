// The fields titles_accordion and content_accordion are designed for you to provide additional information about a category/building block
// You can have as many paragraphs/sections as you wish. Every section must be accompanied by a heading. To create
//several sections you must use the special charters [SPLIT]. See example below:
// titles_accordion: 'HeadingSection1[SPLIT]HeadingSection2'
// content_accordion: 'Content1[SPLIT]Content2'
// The content above is displayed using accordions, but you can easily change the html code for it to be displayed differently (e.g. you can use lists, paragraphs etc.)

Pairing continuous and process-oriented assessment with questioning the students' decision-making process may help to detect AI-generated results. \nThere is no remedy against cheating, but you can support your students by developing course goals together with your students and emphasizing the importance of self-directed learning. \nIf you provide clear learning goals students can use them to check their progress and focus on acquiring the skills and knowledge covered in your course.
