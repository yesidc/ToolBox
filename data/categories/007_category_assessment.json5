// The fields titles_accordion and content_accordion are designed for you to provide additional information about a category/building block
// You can have as many paragraphs/sections as you wish. Every section must be accompanied by a heading. To create
//several sections you must use the special charters [SPLIT]. See example below:
// titles_accordion: 'HeadingSection1[SPLIT]HeadingSection2'
// content_accordion: 'Content1[SPLIT]Content2'
// The content above is displayed using accordions, but you can easily change the html code for it to be displayed differently (e.g. you can use lists, paragraphs etc.)

    description_1: "Online assessment is ideal for checking metacognition incrementally, such as in (reflection) portfolios. Pairing continuous and process-oriented assessment with questioning the students' decision-making process may help to detect AI-generated results. \nThere is no remedy against cheating, but you can support your students by developing course goals together with your students and emphasizing the importance of self-directed learning. \nIf you provide clear learning goals students can use them to check their profress and focus on acquiring the skills and knowledge covered in your course. ",
  description_2: "### What do I have to take into account?  \n\n- There must be opportunities to be assessed online.\n- International students (like in the COSMOS program) can reside in different time zones. \n- Synchronous assessments must be possible to be attended by students in their local time zone from 8:00 to 20:00.",
