# Concept map

## Brief description 
Concept maps are a visualization of links between important concepts of topics, units or even courses. 
They allow to judge the growth in the relative sophistication of your students' mental model or explanation, 
if developed and assessed over time. 
Let your students create  concept map or let them upvote/ down vote the different links between the terms. 

## Use cases
- Helps you to assess student understanding throughout the course and to adjust if necessary
- Suitable for activating students 
- Concept maps serve students as study material for exams 


## Technology 
- <a href="https://www.collaboard.app/de/" target="_blank">Collaboard</a> (access via <a href="https://academiccloud.de/services" target="_blank">Academic Cloud</a> > *”Whiteboard”*): 
Online collaboration board provided by Academic Cloud  for mind maps, concept maps or visualizations.  Import templates and start reconstructing visual representations of 
relationships among concepts or ideas. (**This is the only online collaboration board that is GSDVO compliant**)
- To embedd Collaboard in your Courseware learning material, use the iFrame block. 

## Implementation Steps
1. Should your students come up with their own list of key terms that should be linked? (a) 
 Or do you want them to link  certain terms?   (b)
2. Assemble a list of key terms that should be included (b).
3. Communicate your expectations, i.e. what is acceptable and what not? 

## Teacher Effort 
*MINI: You can use these tips quickly and with little effort in your current teaching.*

Create a list of key terms that you definitely want to see mentioned as a grading rubric. 


## Recommendations 
Remind the students to take notes on the key concepts from the class. You can do so with a Merksatz block in Courseware before or after a micro lecture. 
Depending on the level of the course, you could provide a handful of terms and ask them to add to the list of terms.
