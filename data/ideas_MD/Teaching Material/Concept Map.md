# Concept map

## Brief description 
Visualize the links between important concepts of a topic/ unit/ course. Have students create the concept map or let them upvote/ down vote the different links between the terms. 
Concept maps allow instructors to judge the growth in the relative sophistication of a student’s model or explanation, if developed and assessed over time. 

## Technology 
<a href="https://www.collaboard.app/de/" target="_blank">Collaboard</a> (access via <a href="https://academiccloud.de/services" target="_blank">Academic Cloud</a> > *”Whiteboard”*): 
Online collaboration board provided by Academic Cloud  for mind maps, concept maps or visualizations.  Import templates and start reconstructing visual representations of 
relationships among concepts or ideas. (**This is the only online collaboration board that is GSDVO compliant**)

## Implementation Steps
1. Decide if students should come up with their own list of key terms that should be linked or share(parts of) 
your list with the students. 
2. Assemble a list of key terms that should be included.
3. Communicate what you expect this concept map to look like. 
## Teacher Effort 
1. Time for creating list of key terms 
2. Further involvement depends on the learning scenario / application

## Recommendations 
Remind the students to take notes on the key concepts from the class. You can do so with a box in courseware before or after a micro lecture. 
Depending on the level of the course, you could provide a handful of terms and ask them to add to the list of terms.
