# Reflection portfolio

## Brief Description 	
The reflection portfolio is a tool for students to keep track of their learning process in a reflected manner. It helps to acquire more self-knowledge and consciousness about their learning progress, 
the standards to meet, and awareness for their own dispositions and habits when approaching tasks. 
The portfolio holds short descriptions of an exemplary learning experience for one or more elements of the course and should reflect the student’s personal impression and not group think 
(writing what students have come to agree on because one voice was louder than the others).

## Use Cases (Examples_of_application)	
- After project work or group work phase.
- At the end of the course and as preparation for the exam.
- For reflecting priorities for exam preparation.
- Before group work: What do I want to contribute/ learn? What am I already skilled at? What do I bring to the group work?  

## Technology (Tool) 
- <a href="https://digitale-lehre.virtuos.uni-osnabrueck.de/2023/08/23/alles-rund-um-das-update-auf-stud-ip-5-3/">Stud.IP Workplace using Courseware learning material</a>: 
It is now possible to share a courseware created in the "Workplace" with other users. 
This means that you can now give your students the task, for example, of creating a courseware in 
their own "workspace" and keeping a learning and development portfolio in it. The students 
can then share this portfolio with you so that they can view, comment on and evaluate it. 
We explain the exact procedure in detail in this <a href="https://video4.virtuos.uni-osnabrueck.de/paella/ui/watch.html?id=000392fa-c188-48aa-b291-1ad9333d5578">video</a> (German). 
- <a href="/static/tbcore/support_documents/How_to_add_task_plugIn_to_Stud.Ip_course.pdf" target="_blank">Tasks (reflection) Plug-In</a> for reflection tasks: Students submit free text answers or upload a file (document, mp3, etc.). 
The  plug-in provides a quick overview about who already submitted their answer. 
You can give upload rights to particular students in the task section of somebody else, 
so they can give feedback to each other or submit an assignment together.
- <a href="https://hilfe.studip.de/help/5.0/en/Basis/Dateien" target="_blank">Files</a>: Reflection portfolio files can be up- and downloaded by students and lecturers. 
-  <a href="https://hilfe.studip.de/help/5.0/en/Basis/CoursewareSeite" target="_blank">Courseware</a>: Create a page for each student in the courseware of your course in which they write their portfolio. 
	Ideally, you create a reflection portfolio template with writing prompts in your workspace in stud.IP and copy it as many times as the number of students into your courseware. 
	Now, you can give <a href="/static/tbcore/support_documents/Granting_Editing_Rights_for_Courseware_Pages.pdf" target="_blank">editing and reading rights</a> to individual students or groups for pages within courseware and you can make pages invisible for certain participants.

## Teacher Effort
***MAXI** (This tip requires more intensive preparation and is more suitable as an idea for future semesters.)*

Reading the Reflection portfolios (pass/ fail) depends on the time frame that the portfolio represents. 

## Recommendations 
- Portfolios should substitute some of the current assignments and should not be simply added to the workload.
- You can assess what the students are up to and what they are involved with pertaining subject matter and prerequisites, or whether they understand 
	the task by asking them to self-assess their past as well as their present work. This allows you to gain more insight into how sophisticated and 
	accurate a student’s view is on tasks, criteria and standards they are to master.

### We recommend using reflection portfolios as: 
- The tip on the scale for grading.
- Means for individual assessment.
- Encouraging student reflection. 
- Set a word limit of about 750 words.

## Testimony 	
*„Ich war ja erst skeptisch was die individual reflection portfolios angeht, aber ich lese gerade einen Teil und das ist so toll was die schreiben! 
Es ist sehr schön zu sehen, wie einzelne Aufgaben den Leuten richtig was gebracht haben und was für Soft Skills die aus dem Kurs mit rausnehmen.“*
