# Student Engagement 
Remote students are not integrated in a study community per se and need explicit reminders and motivation to keep up with the course.
Remote students are more isolated than on-site students and therefore instructors have to give information explicitly that they otherwise would have relied on that students “just know”.

### What is Student Engagement? 
\n\n\"Student engagement refers to the degree of attention, curiosity, interest, optimism, and passion
that students show when they are learning or being taught, which extends to the level of motivation they 
have to learn and progress in their education.\" (

\n\nIt is shaped by the relationship to others in the course, but also by the learning 
activities and the learning environment. Try to create a rhythm or regular time structure in the course connected to the content, e.g. by sending emails, publishing content, reminding on tasks to do, etc. ",

### Why does it matter? 
\n\nOnline students are not per se integrated in a study community and need explicit reminders 
and motivation to keep up with the course. \nCarefully crafted learning activities, interactions 
and a considerately designed learning environment support students to keep up with the course, when 
studying remotely can be isolating. \nMake sure you address information explicitly and communicate 
clearly, even though you would have otherwise relied on students “just knowing”. ",
