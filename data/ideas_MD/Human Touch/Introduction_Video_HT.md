# Introduction video

## Brief description 	
Welcoming students and giving the course a personal touch is central for online courses. 
A brief introduction video makes the course less anonymous and gives you the opportunity to set the tone for the course. 

There is no fixed template or a "must-do" for an introduction video, 
rather, you can show yourself in a way that you feel comfortable with, 
so students get an authentic impression of you and the course. 
 

## Use cases (Examples_of_application)	
Suitable in every course.  

## Technology (Tool) 
-  <a href="https://digitale-lehre.virtuos.uni-osnabrueck.de/eintrag/opencast-studio/" target="_blank"> Opencast Studio</a>: Create/edit videos without installing software on your computer.

## Implementation steps 
1.	Take short notes about:  
   - What you want to say about yourself (something that allows students to get a good impression of who you are 
       (see the recommendations for inspiration) 
   - How you understand your role as the instructor of the course and 
   - If you have a wish regarding the outcome of the course 
2. Choose your recording mode: Opencast studio (at home) or Lehrkolleg professional recording studio (alte Münze)
3. Prepare your set-up: Software, room lightning, close windows against street noise while recording, microphone and camera. 
4. Record / edit your video to max. 10 min. 
5. Embedd your video in courseware via video blocks. 
6. Send a welcome message to all course participants with a link to your introduction video. 

## Teacher effort (teacher_effort)

*MIDI: These tips are also suitable for current teaching situations, but require a little more preparation.*
- Prepare coarsely what you want to say.
- Video recording + editing: 15-20 min. 
- Uploading the video in your courseware introduction section. 

## Recommendations (recommendations)
The introduction is meant to give students an impression about who their instructor is and not more.
It doesn't need to be perfect and mispronunciations are ok, after all it's human.  
Some inspiration:
- What was the question that initially led you to inquire more in this field? 
- What are your expectations for the course (e.g. participation, questions to address, interaction) 
- What do I want my students to know about me? 
- What is your teaching style/ philosophy? 
- What are you looking forward to? 
- Be authentic and do something that you feel comfortable with. 
- Tell students something that lets them know about your personality: A show you are watching, family photo, your hobby, your pets etc.
- Insert a handwritten signature below your welcome message.
