# Quizze

## Brief Description

Quizzes activate students and make micro lectures much more effective. Quizzes can be multiple choice, open text entry, true or false are great to activate students, e.g. with self-tests. 

# Use Cases

* Lectures which would be rather passive without quizzes. 
* During a synchronous live session to activate students.
* Integrated into asynchronous course material (courseware) to activate students during self-study.

## Technology

* <a href="https://digitale-lehre.virtuos.uni-osnabrueck.de/eintrag/elektronische-uebungen-und-pruefungen-vips/">VIPS</a>: There are several task types you can use to create quizzes. E.g., single choice, multiple choice, gap text etc.

## Implementation Steps

* The content of the quizzes should be guided by the type of knowledge the students should gain from the content. For example, if they should know the facts, ask for a recall of the facts, but if they should understand a concept, try to keep the questions more open.
* Quizzes are created based on learning objectives or the main idea that was meant to be tackled in the unit. 
* Be creative with the different types of format that can be used to create a quizz.

## Teacher Effort
***MINI** (You can use this tip quickly and with little effort in your current teaching.)*

Student assistants need ~ 15-30 minutes to create 1-2 self-tests from the idea to VIPS implementation. 

## Recommendations

An easy way to create VIPS is to take a sentence from the lecture and make it a cloze text.

* Use quizzes to gauge prior knowledge before starting a subsection.
* Place the quizzes right before the micro lectures to activate prior knowledge. 
* Place quizzes right after a video to check understanding and cognitive presence.
* Decide whether they get automated feedback or if the quizzes need manual review. 
* Regular quizzes can become part of the course routine and give students a course pace.
* Quizzes can be used to enforce/ encourage students to work on subjects regularly. 

## Resources

If student assistants create the quizzes, they usually use only the lecture materials but sometimes also additional material (e.g. research papers or other websites) to verify the answers.
