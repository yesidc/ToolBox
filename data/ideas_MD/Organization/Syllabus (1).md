# Syllabus
## Brief description 	
One document - all answers. The syllabus is a course manual, providing complete and exact course information about organizational aspects, prerequisites, requirements, course goals, learning resources, assignment instructions, expectation rubrics and a grading scale.  

## Use cases	
For all courses (many universities require a syllabus for a course). 

## Technology  	
- <a href="https://digitale-lehre.virtuos.uni-osnabrueck.de/eintrag/courseware/" target="_blank">Courseware</a>: Stud.IP's virtual Learning Environment helps you structure and organize the content and sections of your syllabus in a more appealing and easy-to-navigate way.
- <a href="https://studip.uni-osnabrueck.de/dispatch.php/course/details?sem_id=580b5e70656d0c3a0be6ffb824e130d7&again=yes" target="_blank">Syllabus template in Courseware</a> This template gives you a general structure as well as a set of instructions and tips you can use to construct your syllabus. 

## Implementation steps 	
Provide complete and exact information about: 
1.	Course information: Meeting days, time and location, teaching mode, credits and prerequisites 
2.	Instructor contact information: Sample text *“I prefer communication via e-mail and expect you to check your e-mails at https://sogo.uni-osnabrueck.de/SOGo/ and NOT the messages in Stud.IP. Please make sure that your stud.IP messages are forwarded to your email address, so you don't miss our course announcements."*
3.	Course description and schedule
4.	Learning resources, technology and texts
5.	Learning goals of your course 
6.	Assignment information, due dates, instructions and grading rubric/ assessment criteria 
7.	Grading scale 

## Teacher Effort 	
*MAXI: These tips require more intensive preparation and are more suitable as ideas for future semesters.*

The syllabus ties all links of your course together. **The more precise you list the prerequisites, learning goals, your teaching approach and the resources, the more clarity you and your students will have during the semester.** 
The most time consuming yet worthwhile parts of writing a syllabus are: 
- Clear learning goals (they help coming up with meaningful assignments) 
- Clear assignment instructions and expectations
- Teaching mode / learning scenario (when will you meet in person, what should students prepare, how can students participate online, etc.)

## Recommendations 	
- Use this  <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/innovativelearning/developing-courses/syllabus-template/" target="_blank">template from Purdue OWL</a> to fill in your course information. Use the prompts and complete the necessary sections including assignment instructions that clearly outline your expectations of the students' output.
- Give complete and exact information by the start of the semester and always refer to the syllabus section in courseware/ PDF (provide both, a syllabus PDF and a courseware integration of the syllabus).
- Consider adding some words about: 
  - Handling incompletes or late work (less for interaction)
  - Course logistics (less for interaction but organization)

## Reusable	
If you give the same course again, you only need to change the dates. Large parts  can be reused in other courses as well.
