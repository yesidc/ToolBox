# Assignment Checklist 
## Brief Description 
Students need clear directions for the work they are tasked with, especially in remote settings. 
An assignment checklist names the (thinking) skills that you expect to see *proof of* and identifies 
what you accept *as proof*. Giving students clear criteria to check off gives students confidence about 
what and how they study. 
Basically, the assignment checklist lists out all the criteria that you would need to evaluate for grading. 
## Tools
- Use the syllabus (Link to syllabus teaching tool)
- <a href="https://hilfe.studip.de/help/4.6/en/Basis/CoursewareBloeckeBestaetigung" target="_blank">Confirmation block</a> in courseware 

## Implementation Steps
- Confirm that everything on the list is tangible.  
- Don’t worry about stating the obvious, the list needs to be complete, no matter how trivial things may seem. 
- Be transparent and precise about what you want. 
- Keep the items short and align them with the learning objectives. 

## Teacher Effort
***MIDI** (Suitable for current teaching situations, but requires a little more preparation.)*

You have to be very clear about what kind of submissions you *do or do not accept*. Make sure, students would consider the checkpoints you define as clear and understandable, too! 
If you have yet to gain that clarity, you will need about 30 min./ assignment. 

## Recommendations
- Create an overarching checklist for similar assignment types (e.g. video assignment) with some specificities for particular assignment types (e.g. explainer, demonstration, or discussion video)
- "Consider questions like these when developing directions for assignments and tasks: 
    - What exactly do you want students to do?
    - What is the purpose and audience for their work? What products and/or performances should they create? 
    - What should the work include? 
    - What elements are required? … optional? 
    - How will their work be judged? 
    - What qualities are expected? 
    - How good is “good enough?"  (<a href="https://www.ascd.org/blogs/seven-strategies-for-supporting-student-learning-in-a-remote-environment">McTighe & Martin-Kniep Seven strategies for supporting student learning in a remote environment, 2020</a>)

## Testimony 
“Overall, the assignment submissions show less variance and less individuality, but almost all of the submissions were exceptionally high quality and only very few students missed the basic requirements for a good explainer video.“  (Laura Krieger) 
## Use Cases
- For complex assignments where students have to analyse, evaluate, create, or develop something on their own. 
- When students work independently and with little contact with you or little to no feedback loops.
