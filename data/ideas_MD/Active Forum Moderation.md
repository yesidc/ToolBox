# Forum Moderation
## Brief Description
### The learning process 
In discussion forums, moderators have two roles, a pedagogical and a social role. One is directed at 
**pedagocical facilitation and guidance of learning** and the other focuses on social aspects such as creating an environment with **positive relationships and a safe
atmosphere**. 

Discussion boards moderators have to **facilitate and guide learning**
in online discussions, for instance by  
- posing questions that focus on critical concepts, principles and skills, 
- prompting controversial questions to activate students
- maintaining focus on the topic (Berge, 2008; Salmon, 2013). 

The pedagogical tasks are about making sure that students encounter enough thought stimulating 
questions and challenges and that misunderstandings are corrected.

### The learning atmosphere

The social learning environment is equally important for students to study effectively. 
Moderators can stimulate a positive and warm atmosphere by picking up students' contributions
and proactively offering feedback about the learning progress and results. 

So, the social role of a facilitator is to create an environment with 
**positive relationships and a safe atmosphere**. This aspect focuses more on the social aspect of giving feedback than the content of feedback.
However, both, social and pedagogical role are important for forum moderation (Anderson, Rourke, Garrison & Archer, 2001; Martin, Ritzhaupt, Kumar & Budhrani, 2019).

## Implementation Steps 
Set aside some time in your calendar for moderating the forum 2-3 times a week. 
Use the resources listed under supplementary material in this tool box for guidance. 
## Teacher Effort 
***MIDI** (Suitable for current teaching situations, but requires a little more preparation, and in this case regular effort.)*

## Recommendations
- Be aware that teaching and participation can happen at any time and are not tied to a fixed schedule, so 
use this to your advantage. 
- Relatedness and positive interdependence among students, and between students and the course can be further supported by collaboration techniques when designing tasks.
