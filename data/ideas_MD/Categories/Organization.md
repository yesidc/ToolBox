# Organization 
Online students don’t have contact with many other students to get information along the semester, 
and on-site classroom norms are not available for neither students nor instructors. The building block *Organization* involves a thorough course planning including the process, structure, evaluation and interaction components of your course. Therefore,

- course instructors must be explicit and transparent in their planning. 

Additionally, highly individual factors like a designated study place,  family obligations, political or financial factors alter possibilities and flexibility regarding study place or study times. 

- Having all organizational information upfront is essential to plan study times, to accommodate to working 
hours of student jobs, and to compensate missing classroom norms. 

Being able to plan their semester, helps students to create a study “rhythm” 
that others get from attending courses and for planning their studies – an important factor for effective online teaching and learning (Martin, Ritzhaupt, Kumar & Budhrani, 2019).

### What Do I Have to Organize for Teaching Online? 
Thoroughly plan your course, including: \n\n- Interaction components 
- Classroom norms 
- Course structure 
- Feedback loops
- Teaching mode 
- Assessment 

Communicate all organizational information upfront and make them asynchronously 
accessible in a prominent place. This way, you support your students in planning study times, 
you accommodate to working hours of student jobs and compensate missing classroom norms.
This helps to create a study “rhythm” that on-site students might get from attending courses, 
which is an important factor for effective online teaching and learning

### Why Does it Matter? 
\n\n- Online students are often not as connected to fellow students as on-site students. \n- Online students often miss important information shared on-site along the semester.  \n- Students live in diverse circumstances and they might differ in: \n    - having a designated study place or not\n    - family obligations \n    - political or financial factors \n    - working hours\n    - focus time \n    - (cultural) classroom norms",


## Requirements: 
Give complete, exact information (incl. teaching mode) available at the 
start of the semester concerning: 

- Course information: meeting days and time for courses with 
synchronous meetings, Instructional modality, as a way to help
students understand how the course is designed, ECTS, 
- Prerequisites: „linear algebra“ is too vague. Please list the prerequisites concisely, i.e. in a way that students can check if they need to brush up the prerequisites. You can list UOS or external courses that cover the prerequisites.
- Teaching staff contact information
- Course description
- Learning resources, technology and texts
- Learning outcomes / course goals
- Assignments
