# Grading rubric 
## Brief Description 
Grading rubrics put assessment criteria on a continuum and guide the grading based on the criteria that were established before the exam. They help communicate grades to students and show that learning and understanding is a process. 

## Use Cases
Especially useful for project work, essays, and presentations but also for exams. 

## Technology
- Upload the grading rubric PDF in the  <a href="https://hilfe.studip.de/help/5.0/en/Basis/Dateien" target="_blank">files section</a> and provide 
a preview within your learning material with Courseware with the <a href="https://hilfe.studip.de/help/5.0/en/Basis/CoursewareBloeckePDF" target="_blank">PDF preview block</a> (before grading) 
- Once graded, hand out paper copies or send individual files via email or Element. 

## Implementation Steps 
- Focus on describing, not evaluating. Rubrics are about quality not quantity.
- When describing content, the following criteria will help: 
  - Accuracy 
  - Specificity and use of examples 
  - Relevance 
  - Completeness/ thoroughness

1. Describe the task.
2. Identify quality attributes/indicators.
3. Develop dimensions.
4. Describe the levels.
5. Use the rubric.
6. Revise the rubric.

## Teacher Effort
***MAXI** (This tip requires more intensive preparation and is more suitable as an idea for future semesters.)*
- Using the rubric while grading can reduce the time necessary to evaluate an assignment. 
- Preparing the rubric can take longer as the grading work is "front-loaded" but is highly dependent on the assignment type to be graded.
- Using a rubric makes grading more transparent which reduces the extent of questions regarding grades. 
 
## Recommendations 
Although certain criteria are more important than the other, only some of the criteria needs to be met. A rubric is meant to make the grading more accountable, but it should not provide an objective grade that can be calculated. This allows for flexible or individual grading while adhering to criteria.

## Reusable
Grading rubrics can be easily adapted to different courses if the assignment types are similar which further reduces the workload necessary to prepare another rubric once a first example has been produced.
